# Overview

This is a repository that contains system design documentation for the DriverPass application from my project as a student. It includes information about the process model, object model, system components, and design considerations.

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a comprehensive system for DriverPass that encompasses driver training courses, practice tests, and scheduling of driving lessons. The system aims to be accessible both online and offline to enhance the pass rate for student drivers.

This provides an overview of the DriverPass system design, encompassing various models, requirements, limitations, and assumptions. For detailed information, refer to the associated documents and materials.

Module Eight Journal Questions:
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project works to have a system that allows for online classes, tests/quizzes, and appointment scheduling for driving lessons/vehicles. The Client is DriverPass and the system needs to be able to use various tools, functions, and DMV collaboration to improve students' chances of passing their driver tests. 

What did you do particularly well?
I feel as if I did particularly well in creating UML diagrams and identifying objects in these diagrams too. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise it would be to do better in identifying the system requirements. I could have improved my own by stating the specific requirements instead of naming groups where they can be grouped. I did happen to learn from that experience although.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I would interpret the user’s needs and implement them into my design by creating similar UMLs. As well I know how important it can be to have clear communication and collaboration between teams. It is so important to consider the user's needs when designing as we are creating a product that they are likely paying for and will represent their brand. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software by first writing pseudocode, then trying to start implementing basic functions to run/debug. Then continue to build my code over time while following my pseudo code and understanding changes the project may occur during development. Techniques I would use in the future to analyze and design a system are prototyping which is essentially a scaled-down version of the product that can be tested to see if aligns with the base idea of the Clients needs.
