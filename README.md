# Overview

This is a repository that contains system design documentation for the DriverPass application from my project as a student. It includes information about the process model, object model, system components, and design considerations.

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a comprehensive system for DriverPass that encompasses driver training courses, practice tests, and scheduling of driving lessons. The system aims to be accessible both online and offline to enhance the pass rate for student drivers.
This provides an overview of the DriverPass system design, encompassing various models, requirements, limitations, and assumptions. For detailed information, refer to the associated documents and materials.
